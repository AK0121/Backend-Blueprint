# 🧠 Backend-Blueprint

> A bulletproof starter backend architecture for frontend devs becoming full-stack artists.

## 🎯 What Is This?

**Backend-Blueprint** is a clean, minimal backend system built using the latest **Next.js App Router API routes**.

It’s made for:
- Frontend devs learning backend for the first time
- Builders who want to practice real-world HTTP methods (GET, POST, DELETE)
- Makers who want to simulate a full-stack flow without needing a full DB yet

Think of it as your **sandbox to understand how client ↔ API ↔ server ↔ DB** works — without complexity.
